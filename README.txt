Hi! This is my first python project, so apologies if it sucks (because it does).

Firstly, some limitations: the app only works with .jpeg files (it will convert pictures to jpeg and save the original in a separate folder). The tagging works for windows, though will not be visible for most platforms (because it uses windows xp keywords which I think are for .mp3 files). Certain android apps (F-Stop is what I use) also use xp keywords and will recognize these tags. The config file currently does nothing. The app cannot mass tag pictures. It probably won't work if multiple use it at the same time (since it's built as a webapp).

With those out of the way, here is how to use the app! The first thing you want to do is to edit the app.py file and change the first two paths (absPicturePath and picturePath). absPicturePath is the absolute path to the folder where your pictures are stored. picturePath is the relative path (from where app.py is). This HAS to be 'static/SOMETHING'. You COULD also just put all of your pictures in static but there is a way around this. Make sure the absolute path has "\\" instead of single forward slashes (blame python).

Once setting this up, run the app using the command line or bash (type cmd in the search bar should be good enough, then type python3 app.py). This will throw an error if the folder inside static doesn't exist, either put your pictures in the folder or use the given command to make a symbolic link to the directory (its like a shortcut). Run the app again and click on the link that says 'tiddy :D'. If you get an error, it will probably be for some picture that can't be identified. You will have to tag that image manually, sorry. Move it from the directory.

At this point, the app SHOULD be working. You can move more pictures to the directory and press the 'Update JSON' link to add them into the list. To tag an image, enter the tag into the box into the middle of the screen and press enter. If you did this right, a checkbox with blue text should appear on the right side of the screen. Congrats! You've tagged your first image! You can remove a tag by either typing it manually (typing bean once adds it, typing it again removes it, typing it again adds it back), or clicking on the checkbox and click the 'submit tag changes' button.

In the top left of this page, there are two buttons and a text field. This is to switch between pictures, with the text field being the current index of the image, you can use this to quickly navigate to say, the 115th image in the folder.
